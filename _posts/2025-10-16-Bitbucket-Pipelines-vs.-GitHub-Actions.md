## Bitbucket Pipelines vs. GitHub Actions: A Deep Technical Comparison

I’ve had the chance to work  with both of these CI/CD tools. In fact, a recent migration I led from **Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions** gave me a deeper understanding of their architectural and operational differences.  
This comparison is based not only on my own experience, but also on official documentation, and discussions from communities like **Reddit** and **Stack Overflow**.

Before diving in, I should say this upfront — I’m not completely neutral.  
Personally, I find **GitHub Actions** far more dynamic and flexible. Its **community-driven ecosystem** and **Actions Marketplace** make it stand out.  
While, **Bitbucket Pipelines** still deserves credit for its **simplicity**, **ease of use**, and **reliability in straightforward use cases**.

### Key Technical Comparison Table

| Feature | Bitbucket Pipelines (BBP) | GitHub Actions (GHA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Configuration File** | `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` (root directory) | YAML files in `.github/workflows/` |
| **Base Runner Support** | Primarily **Linux**. Windows and macOS runners are supported. | **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows Server** with full, stable support. |
| **Max Job/Step Timeout** | **120 minutes** per step (can be extended to 720 min on higher-tier plans). | **360 minutes** per job on GitHub-hosted runners. |
| **Max Total Workflow Runtime** | Up to **600 minutes (10 hours)** per pipeline run. | Up to **7 days (10,080 minutes)** per workflow, including approval or wait steps. |
| **Reusable Workflows** | No direct equivalent to GHA’s reusable workflows; can be simulated using templates or Docker images. | Full support for **Reusable Workflows** and **Composite Actions**. |
| **Docker/Container Support** | Each step runs in its own isolated container. **Docker-based** execution by default. | Native container job support. Steps in the same job share the same environment. |
| **Self-Hosted Runner Support** | Supported (Linux, Windows, macOS). Some **Windows limitations** (e.g., SSH keys, service containers). | Robust self-hosted support, though idle runners are removed after 14 days. |
| **Free Tier Build Minutes** | **50 minutes/month** (Free Plan). | **2,000 minutes/month** for private repos — significantly more generous. |

> Note: Bitbucket does not have an official Terraform provider, and based on my experience,its API is not developer-friendly.  
> GitHub, on the other hand, offers both an official Terraform provider and strong API integration.

### Data and Value Transfer: A Core Architectural Difference

The execution architecture of each platform creates a major difference in how data and small values are transferred between steps.
In Bitbucket, even passing a small variable from one step to the next can be frustrating.

| Mechanism | Bitbucket Pipelines | GitHub Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File Transfer (Large Data)** | Files must be uploaded/downloaded as **artifacts** between steps — there is **no shared workspace**. | Supports **artifacts** (across jobs) and a **shared workspace** (within a job). |
| **Metadata/Value Transfer (Small Data)** | Complex and cumbersome; usually requires artifacts or scripting. | Native and straightforward: **step outputs** (`$GITHUB_OUTPUT`), **job outputs**, and **persistent environment variables** (`$GITHUB_ENV`). |

### Known Limitations and Real-World Issues

| Platform | Known Limitations / Bugs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bitbucket Pipelines** | **Step Isolation:** Each step is fully isolated; data sharing requires artifacts or complex workarounds. |
|  | **IPv4 Only:** No native IPv6 support. |
|  | **Concurrency Limits:** Parallelism depends on plan tier; max 100 steps per pipeline. |
|  | **Queueing Issues:** Pipelines may  get stuck in the “queued” state due to resource allocation. |
| **GitHub Actions** | **Self-Hosted Windows Runner Bug:** Some runners deregister before the 14-day idle threshold. |
|  | **Marketplace Security Risks:** Third-party actions can introduce supply chain vulnerabilities; **action pinning** (commit SHA) is essential. |
|  | **Debugging Difficulty:** Limited runner visibility and verbose logs make deep debugging time-consuming. |
|  | **Reusable Workflow Depth:** Limited to four nested calls; environment propagation can be tricky in complex setups. |

### Summary and Conclusion

**GitHub Actions** is the better choice for teams that need **flexibility, workflow composability, and ecosystem integration**.  
Its generous limits, powerful reusable workflows, and native context management make it well-suited for projects of any size. However, teams must be carefull of **third-party action security** and **self-hosted runner lifecycle management**.

**Bitbucket Pipelines**, on the other hand, excels in **simplicity** and **tight Atlassian integration** (Jira, Confluence).  
Its isolated architecture may feel restrictive for complex workflows, but it provides a clean, predictable, and easy-to-maintain environment for standard CI/CD needs.
